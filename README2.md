## Objectives of the module

We will analyze a dataset provided by an e-commerce marketplace called [Olist](https://www.olist.com) to answer the CEO's question:

> How to increase customer satisfaction (so as to increase profit margin) while maintaining a healthy order volume?

## About Olist 🇧🇷

<img src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/best-practices/olist.png" width="500"/>

Olist is a leading e-commerce service that connects merchants to main marketplaces in Brazil. They provide a wide range of offers including inventory management, dealing with reviews and customer contacts to logistic services.

Olist charges sellers a monthly fee. This fee is progressive with the volume of orders.

Here are the seller and customer workflows:

**Seller:**

- Seller joins Olist
- Seller uploads products catalogue
- Seller gets notified when a product is sold
- Seller hands over an item to the logistic carrier

👉 Note that multiple sellers can be involved in one customer order!

**Customer:**

- Browses products on the marketplace
- Purchases products from Olist.store
- Gets an expected date for delivery
- Receives the order
- Leaves a review about the order

👉 A review can be left as soon as the order is sent, meaning that a customer can leave a review for a product he did not receive yet!

## Dataset

The dataset consists of ~100k orders from 2016 and 2018 that were made on the Olist store, available as csv files on Le Wagon S3 bucket (❗️the datasets available on Kaggle may be slightly different).

✅ Download the 9 datasets compressed in the `olist.zip` file, unzip it and store them in your `~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv` folder:

```bash
curl https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/olist/olist.zip > ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/olist.zip
unzip -d ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/ ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/olist.zip
rm ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/olist.zip
```

Check you have the 9 datasets on your machine:

```bash
ls ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv
```

## Setup

### 1 - Project Structure
Go to your local `~/code/<user.github_nickname>` folder.
This will be your project structure for the week.

```bash
.
# Your whole code logic and data, this is your "package"
├── context-and-setup
    ├── data                # Your data source (git ignored)
    |   ├── csv
    |   |   ├── olist_customers_dataset.csv
    |   |   └── olist_orders_dataset.csv
    |   |   └── ...
    |   ├── README.md       # database documentation
    |
    ├── olist               # Your data-processing logic
    |   ├── data.py
    |   ├── product.py
    |   ├── seller.py
    |   ├── utils.py
    |   └── __init__.py.    # turns the olist folder into a "package"
# Your notebooks & analyses, challenge-by-challenge
├── data-preparation
├── exploratory-analysis
├── orders
├── simple-analysis
├── ...
├── logit
├── olist_ceo_request
```

### 2 - Edit the `PYTHONPATH`

Add `olist` path to your `PYTHONPATH`.

This will allow you to easily import modules defined in `olist` in your notebooks throughout the week.

Open your terminal and navigate to your home directory by running:

```bash
cd
```

Now you'll need to open your `.zshrc` file. As you might have noticed the file starts with a dot which means it's a hidden file. To be able to see this file in your terminal you'll need to run the command below, the flag `-a` will allow you to see hidden files:

```bash
ls -a
```

Next lets open the file using your text editor:

```bash
code .zshrc
```

Now in your terminal run:
```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }} && echo "export PYTHONPATH=\"$(pwd):\$PYTHONPATH\""
```

👉 Copy the resulting output line from your terminal and paste it at the bottom of your ~/.zshrc file. Don't forget to save and restart all your terminal windows to take this change into account.



### 🔥 Check your setup

Go to your `{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}` folder and run an `ipython` session:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}
ipython
```

Then type the following to check that the setup phase from the previous exercise worked:

```python
from olist.data import Olist
Olist().ping()
# => pong
```

If you get something else than `pong`, raise a ticket to get some help from a TA. You might have a problem with the `$PYTHONPATH`.

## Push your code on GitHub

From your `{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}` directory, commit and push your code:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}
git add .
git commit -m 'kick off olist challenge'
git push origin master
```
